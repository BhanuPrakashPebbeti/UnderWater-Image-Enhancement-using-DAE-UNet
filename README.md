# UnderWater-Image-Enhancement-using-DAE-UNet
#### Underwater image enhancement has been attracting much attention due to its significance in marine engineering and aquatic robotics. Deep learning models are used which takes raw under water images as input and gives corresponding enhanced images as output.
#### Denoising AutoEncoder with Skip Connections from Encoder to Decoder (inspired from UNet) is used to Enhance the Under water images
